# Smart Contract Security Audits

 These audits are part of my learning projects while completing the Cyfrin Updraft Course on smart contract security research. This repository showcases my journey in exploring blockchain security, where I apply the skills and knowledge gained from the course to real-world contracts.

## Overview

This repository documents the security audits I've conducted as part of my learning process. Each audit involves analyzing smart contracts for potential vulnerabilities and proposing mitigation strategies. The projects listed below are focused on enhancing my expertise in smart contract auditing and blockchain security.

## Learning Process

As part of my ongoing education in blockchain security, I am currently enrolled in the Cyfrin Updraft Course. Through this course, I am gaining hands-on experience with:

- Smart Contract Auditing: Learning how to identify common vulnerabilities in decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts.
- Security Best Practices: Understanding secure coding techniques and patterns to minimize risks in Solidity-based applications.
- Tool Usage: Gaining proficiency with auditing tools like Slither, Aderyn, and manual code review.

These audits reflect my progress and application of what I have learned so far. I aim to continuously refine my skills as I delve deeper into smart contract security.
